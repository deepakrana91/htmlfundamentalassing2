        <h1>Frontend developement</h1>
      <div>  <p1>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing 
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and 
            interact with them directly.</p1></div>
           <br>
        <div>    <p2>The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer</p2></div>
